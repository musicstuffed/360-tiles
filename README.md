The purpose of this website is to advertise a tiling business.
I don't expect any of it to be especially perfect but it is functional.

Diving into the structure:

This is a basic 3 page site with landing page, portgolio page and contact page with links to social media in the footer.

UI & UX have been considered. 

This particular site has been built using flexbox and media queries. However if I'd been more ahead I would have used flexgrid for obvious reasons.

Tested the code through w3c validators. I could not get lighthouse going. 
I'm using firefox for my dev tools.
